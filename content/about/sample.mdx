# The Nez Percé (Nimíipuu)
 
This a sample page for scholarly content with historical context relating to the [Nez Percé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce), also known as the Nimíipuu.
 
## A IIIF Viewer
 
A IIIF viewer is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />
 
## Referenced Items
 
The `<ReferencedItems />` automatically outputs a grid of items that are referenced by the current page.
 
<ReferencedItems />
 
## Leveraging Metadata
 
### Using the Viewer
 
The `<Viewer />` component supports IIIF Collections. This allows you to reference a IIIF Collection that is generated by Canopy IIIF. In this example, we are referencing a Collection of items that have a `date` of `1905`.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />
 
### Using the Slider
 
Alternatively, you can use the `<Slider />` component to render a carousel of items that link to the local relative `/work` pages representing the Manifests.
 
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1905.json" />
