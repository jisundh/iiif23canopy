## A IIIF Viewer
 
A IIIF viewer is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="https://cdm16786.contentdm.oclc.org/iiif/korean:10853/manifest.json" />
